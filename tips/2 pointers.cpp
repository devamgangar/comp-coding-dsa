//1)sliding window: (cf b.books)
//Optimized Two-Pointer Sliding Window
//You can simplify and speed up your solution to an O(n) pass using a classic two-pointer (sliding window) approach. Maintain a window [lâ€¦r] whose sum of reading times never exceeds t. Expand r one book at a time, and whenever you overflow, shrink the window from the left.

    important to see what happens if both equal! if u run into another loop approach will fail
    return 0;
