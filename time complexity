time taken!=time complexity
rate at which tme taken increase wrt size of input
Big O notation!
O()

rules:
1)worst case scenario
2)avoid constants
3)avoid lower values

space complexity!
auxilary space(space that u use to solve the problem)+
input space(space that u use to store the problem)

1s = 10^8 operations
2s= 2^10^8 operations
